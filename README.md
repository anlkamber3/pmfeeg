# Blind Source Separation in Neuroscience 

In this project, we brought Polytopic Matrix Factorization (PMF) that provides $\textit{identifiable polytopes}$ to extend feature attributes of latent factors to the neuroscience realm to extract latent vector components associated with distinct subnetworks. Due to the absence of ground truths for the sources expected to be extracted from EEG signals, we used the best-fitted dipole as the ground truth and residual variance as the error metric.
